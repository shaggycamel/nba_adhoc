"""Canonical team-game calendar, and the report-to-schedule date alignment.

`league_game_schedule` is the authority on which games exist and in what
order, but its `game_date` is not always the date the injury report filed
the game under: for 2021-22 the whole schedule sits one day early (its
Finals end on 2022-06-15, the real Game 6 was 2022-06-16). Where the report
carries a `game_id` the two agree exactly, which is how the offset below is
measured rather than assumed.

A constant per-season offset is harmless for everything except joining the
report to a game, because game ordering and day-gaps within a season are
differences and the offset cancels. So the fix is applied only to a separate
`report_date` column and the original date is kept.
