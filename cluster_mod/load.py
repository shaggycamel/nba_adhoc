"""Cleaned loaders. Each one fixes a defect found in the raw dumps.

Defects handled here (see scripts/audit.py for the evidence):

1. `nba.player_box_score` encodes DNPs as `usg_pct = 0.0` with a null `min`,
   not as missing rows. 105394 / 589082 rows (17.9%) are DNPs, so a naive mean
   usage reads 0.151 against a played-only 0.1839. `box_scores` flags them.
2. `statyx.advanced_stats` is duplicated ~2x by a bad season join: 116972 rows
   collapse to 57255 unique (player_id, game_id), and both season labels span
   the identical date range. The `season` column is discarded and rebuilt from
   the game map; conflicting duplicates are averaged.
3. statyx ids are translated into the nba id space via `cluster_mod.ids`.
